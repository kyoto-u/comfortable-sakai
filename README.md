## Cache
In order to reduce the network load on Sakai LMS, we have implemented a cache function for fetching assignments and quizzes from REST API.
The default cache interval is as follows:
- Assignment fetching --- 2 minutes
- Quiz fetching --- 10 minutes

The cache time can be changed in the configuration tab in `miniSakai`.
